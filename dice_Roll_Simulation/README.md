# Dice Roll Simulation

Welcome to the Dice Roll Simulation project! This project simulates the rolling of a dice, providing a fun and interactive way to learn about randomness and probability.

## Description

The Dice Roll Simulation is a simple web application that simulates the roll of a dice. Each time the user clicks the "Roll" button, a random number between 1 and 6 is generated, mimicking the roll of a six-sided dice. The result is then displayed on the screen, along with an image of the corresponding dice face.

## Features

- **Random Dice Roll**: Generates a random number between 1 and 6 each time the "Roll" button is clicked.
- **Dice Face Display**: Displays an image of the dice face corresponding to the rolled number.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic of generating random numbers and updating the UI.
